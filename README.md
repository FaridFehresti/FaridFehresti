## Journey into Coding

My journey into the world of programming started with a mathematics diploma and a determination to learn. Despite never stepping foot into a university, I've embraced the self-taught coder life and have continuously expanded my knowledge and skills.

## Music and More

When I'm not crafting elegant code, you can find me strumming away on my electric guitar. Just like coding, I taught myself how to play, finding joy and creativity in both endeavors.

## Coding Philosophy

I'm a firm believer in writing clean, maintainable code. I adhere to best practices and pay close attention to naming conventions like camelCase and kebab-case. It's not just about making things work; it's about making them work efficiently and elegantly.
