Farid Fehresti

Full-stack JavaScript engineer focused on building clean, scalable web systems.

I work across the stack — crafting modern frontends and designing reliable backends — with a strong emphasis on architecture, type safety, and long-term maintainability.

Stack

TypeScript · JavaScript
React · Next.js · Angular
Node.js · NestJS
Tailwind · MUI · Radix UI

Principles

Clean, predictable architecture

Type-safe, readable code

Performance & scalability first

Pragmatic engineering over hype

Outside of software, I play electric guitar and enjoy learning complex systems.
